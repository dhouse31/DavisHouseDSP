(3.4) Frequency of bins is the max frequency divided by the total number of bins. In this case:
max frequency is 22050Hz (for 44100Hz sampling rate) divided by the number of bins which is the FFT size (len(x))/2
Frequency resolution is then 22050/11025 = 2Hz

(3.5) The frequency resolution would change because the final number of bins would change (based on the question above)

(4.1) Using the rect window method returns the same result as without the window parameter. Using the hann window
method will result in the same magnitude plot, but in the shape of a hann window (weighted cosine), the lengths of the 
ffts are the same but the magnitudes differ.
